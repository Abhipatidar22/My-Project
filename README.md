Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning Algorithms.
The Stock Price Predictor is a Streamlit-based web application that simulates stock price predictions using synthetic data. It allows users to input a stock ticker (e.g., "AAPL" for Apple) and generates a forecast for the next day's closing price based on historical trends.
Since this is a demo application, it does not fetch real-time stock market data. Instead, it generates synthetic stock prices to demonstrate how predictive modeling works.
Key Features
1. User-Friendly Interface
•	Stock Ticker Input: Users can enter any stock symbol (e.g., "TSLA," "GOOGL").
•	Date Range Selection: Users can choose a start and end date for historical data analysis.
•	Responsive Design: The app adjusts dynamically based on user inputs.
2. Synthetic Data Generation
•	The app simulates stock prices using a random walk model with drift and volatility.
•	Key Parameters:
o	Starting Price: $100 (default)
o	Daily Volatility: 2% (simulates real-world stock fluctuations)
o	Drift Factor: 0.05% (simulates a slight upward trend over time)
3. Price Prediction Model
•	Uses linear regression to predict the next day's closing price.
•	Steps in Prediction:
1.	Converts dates to numerical values (ordinal dates).
2.	Fits a linear regression model to historical prices.
3.	Extends the trend to predict the next day’s price.
4.	Calculates a 95% confidence interval to show prediction uncertainty.
4. Visualization & Metrics
•	Last Known Price vs. Predicted Price: Side-by-side comparison.
•	Error Bar Plot: Shows the predicted price with upper and lower bounds.
•	Prediction Range: Displays the expected price range (e.g., "150.20−150.20−155.80").
5. Caching Mechanism
•	Stores previously generated stock data in a local cache (using pickle) for faster reloads.
•	Avoids regenerating the same synthetic data repeatedly.
6. Error Handling
•	Validates date inputs (ensures the end date is after the start date).
•	Displays user-friendly error messages if something goes wrong.

How It Works (Step-by-Step)
1.	User Input:
o	The user enters a stock ticker (e.g., "MSFT") and selects a date range.
2.	Data Generation:
o	If cached data exists, it loads from the cache.
o	If not, it generates synthetic stock prices for the given date range.
3.	Prediction Model:
o	The app applies linear regression to the historical prices.
o	Predicts the next day’s closing price and calculates a confidence interval.
4.	Display Results:
o	Shows the last known price and predicted price.
o	Visualizes the prediction range using an error bar plot.
o	Provides a brief explanation of the prediction methodology.
Future Improvements
  Integrate Real Stock APIs (e.g., Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage)
  Add More Advanced Models (e.g., LSTM, ARIMA)
  Support Multiple Stocks Comparison
  Add Moving Averages & Technical Indicators
